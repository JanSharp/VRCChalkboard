Common files and scripts are, well, commonly used across multiple other scripts. It's like the core.

That means when importing a unity package and you choose to only import part of it, make sure to always include this Common folder. I'll try my best to document which files are used where, but ultimately you're always on the safe side having this folder included and imported.
